This is an imaginary online store, which I have implemented using PHP(PDO), MySQL, JavaScript. Combining the front end with the back office dashboard from where the admin can login and then CRUD products. Also, admin are able to see the stock sold-left etc. I am working on to improve the admin panel and the security system at the moment. It has payment gateway too( for paypal only) I am working on to implement stripe and worldpay. Also, a customer invoice which will be sent to the user's email when any item is ordered.
